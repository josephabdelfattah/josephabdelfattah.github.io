                Hello my name is Joseph and I am a microbiologist. I went to school at California State Univerity
                
                named Dominguez Hills.I had a lot of fun their during my first few years there.Once I had gotten my degree, I worked in the Quality Assurance department in a Laboratory that tested for 
                bacteria in products. Then I had decided I wanted to further my education so I am currently at 
                UCI studying coding.
